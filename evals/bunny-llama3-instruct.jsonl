Once your dough is prepared and shaped into a circle (use parchment paper if it's homemade), spread your tomato sauce on top leaving some space at the edge.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/misc17", "category": "difficulty-normal", "prompt": "describe the rule of this sport like I am 8 year old", "reference": "The sport being played in the image is baseball, which is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each. The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning. A full game usually has nine innings.\n- Winning the Game: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "generation": ": In baseball, two teams take turns playing offense and defense.

The assistant's answer does not address the actual problem shown in the image.\n\nRating: 2\n\nThe rating is 2 because the assistant response partially addresses the issue (i.e., the fan stopped working), but it does not correctly identify the specific problem visible in the photo (i.e., the metal rod jamming the blades)."}
{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/power_strip", "category": "difficulty-hard", "prompt": "I can't fit my charger into the power strip, what should i do?", "reference": "It looks like you have a power strip with UK-style outlets and an Apple charger with a US-style plug. To solve this issue, you can use the universal travel adapter you have (shown on the left in your image), which seems to have the capability to adapt a US plug for use in UK outlets. Here’s what you can do:\n\nSlide out the UK plug pins on the travel adapter.\nPlug your Apple charger into the US socket on the front of the travel adapter.\nThen plug the travel adapter into the UK-style power strip.\nMake sure that the power strip is turned off before you insert the adapter, and check the voltage and power ratings on both your charger and the travel adapter to ensure compatibility. Once everything is securely plugged in, turn on the power strip and you should be able to charge your device.", "media_filename": "difficulty-hard_power_strip_ede3475eac0d05ab.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-hard_power_strip_ede3475eac0d05ab.jpg", "generation": ": You could try using a smaller charger or a different power strip that has more available ports.", "score": 2, "evaluator_explanation": " Explanation: The assistant response provides a general solution of using a smaller charger or a different power strip, but it does not address the specific issue mentioned in the ground truth response, which is the incompatibility between a US-style Apple charger and a UK-style power strip. The ground truth response offers a detailed solution using a universal travel adapter.\n\nRating: 2\nThe assistant response is partially correct, as it suggests alternative solutions, but it does not accurately address the specific problem presented in the ground truth response."}

It correctly identifies the keys numbered 1, 3, 5, and 7 as the notes to play a Gm7 chord.

The ground truth response provides the correct note names for each key, making it more comprehensive and accurate.\n\nRating: 3/5. The assistant response is partially correct but could be improved by including the actual note names corresponding to the keys.
