The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning. A full game usually has nine innings.\n- Winning the Game: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "generation": "In this sport, two teams of players try to hit a ball with a bat and run around a field to score points.

BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is great for unclogging pores and reducing the appearance of acne and fine lines. Leave it on for a few minutes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n3. *** Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**:  If you use a toner, like the Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner, it should be applied after exfoliating.\n\n4. **Eucerin Sun Fluid Photoaging Control SPF 50**: Apply sunscreen as the final step in your morning routine. This will protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent photoaging. It's essential to apply sunscreen every morning, regardless of whether you plan to be outdoors.\n\n5. **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Illumination with SPF 50**: You can also apply the CC cream over your sunscreen.

Since you have a sunscreen in your lineup, this should be okay for morning use as long as you protect your skin.\n\n- Eucerin Sun Protection: This should definitely be used in your morning routine to protect your skin from UV damage throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key in the morning is to focus on protection from the sun and environmental pollutants.

However, the question does not specify which cards have been drawn, so we cannot assume that the Jack of hearts has been drawn. Therefore, we need to consider all possible scenarios for the cards that have been drawn and the remaining cards in the deck.\n\nRating: 2\n\nTo calculate the correct probability, we need to consider all possible scenarios for the cards that have been drawn. There are 12 face cards and 13 hearts in the deck, so there are 3 face cards with a hearts suit (King, Queen, Jack of hearts). Out of the 52 cards in the deck, 5 have already been drawn, leaving 47 cards. We need to find the probability of drawing a face card with a hearts suit from the remaining 47 cards.\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n\n1. None of the face cards with a hearts suit have been drawn yet. In this case, there are 3 face cards with a hearts suit and 42 non-face cards remaining in the deck. So the probability of drawing a face card with a hearts suit is 3/47.\n\n2. One of the face cards with a hearts suit has been drawn already. In this case, there are 2 face cards with a hearts suit and 42 non-face cards remaining in the deck. So the probability of drawing a face card with a hearts suit is 2/47.\n\nTo find the overall probability, we need to average these two probabilities, weighted by the probability of each scenario occurring. The probability of scenario 1 occurring is (12-3)/12 = 9/12 = 3/4, and the probability of scenario 2 occurring is 3/12 = 1/4. Therefore, the overall probability is:\n\n(3/4)*(3/47) + (1/4)*(2/47) = (9+2)/(4*47) = 11/188 ≈ 0.0585\n\nSo the correct probability of drawing a face card with a hearts suit from the remaining 47 cards is approximately 5.85%.\n\n"}

Belay glasses use prisms or angled mirrors that allow the belayer to look straight ahead but still see what's happening above them.", "media_filename": "difficulty-hard_cool_glasses_aebd02fc28aa12c8.png", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-hard_cool_glasses_aebd02fc28aa12c8.png", "generation": "The glasses worn by the person in the image are likely used for safety and protection while engaging in activities such as rock climbing. They are designed to protect the eyes from debris, dust, and other potential hazards that may be encountered during the climb. Additionally, the glasses may also provide UV protection and enhance visibility in various lighting conditions, ensuring a safer and more enjoyable climbing experience. <|end|>", "score": 3, "evaluator_explanation": " Explanation: While the assistant response is partially correct in identifying that the glasses are used for safety and protection during rock climbing, it does not specifically mention the primary function of these glasses, which is to assist the belayer in keeping an eye on the climber without straining their neck.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5. The assistant response is partially correct, but it lacks the specific detail about the glasses' primary function for belaying during rock climbing, as mentioned in the ground truth response."}
{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-hard/kings", "category": "difficulty-hard", "prompt": "Who had the best cards if we were playing mus in the 4 kings variant?", "reference": "The player in the top had the best cards, as they would win the biggest (\"handia\"), pairs (\"pareak\") and game (\"jokoa\") rounds. The player in the left would win the smallest (\"txikia\") round.", "media_filename": "difficulty-hard_kings_29d029a01957944b.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-hard_kings_29d029a01957944b.jpg", "generation": "In the 4 Kings variant of Mus, the player with the best cards would be the one who has the four kings in their hand. In the image, there are four kings visible on the green table, which indicates that they are the best cards for this particular game variant. The player who holds these four kings would have a significant advantage over the other players, as they would be able to win the game by playing these cards strategically. <|end|>", "score": 2, "evaluator_explanation": " Explanation: The assistant response incorrectly assumes that the best cards in the 4 Kings variant of Mus are simply the four kings themselves. However, the ground truth response explains that the best cards depend on the specific rounds being played and the combination of cards held by each player. The player in the top would win the biggest, pairs, and game rounds, while the player in the left would win the smallest round.\n\nRating: 2\n\nThe assistant response partially addresses the question but fails to accurately describe the best cards in the context of the 4 Kings variant of Mus, as it does not consider the specific rounds and combinations of cards held by each player."}
