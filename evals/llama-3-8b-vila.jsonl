What's the best way to do it?\nASSISTANT: Roasting vegetables is a great way to bring out their natural flavors and add a nice, slightly caramelized taste. Here are some tips to help you roast your vegetables to perfection:\n1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or aluminum foil.\n2. Wash and chop your vegetables into even-sized pieces. You can use any combination of vegetables you like, but some popular choices include carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and onions.\n3. Toss the vegetables in a small amount of olive oil, making sure they are evenly coated. You can also use a flavored oil, such as garlic or herb-infused oil, to add extra flavor.\n4. Season the vegetables with your favorite spices and herbs. Some popular choices include salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, cumin, and thyme.\n5. Spread the vegetables out in a single layer on the baking sheet, making sure they are not overlapping. This will ensure even cooking and prevent the vegetables from becoming soggy.\n6. Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven for 20-30 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly caramelized. You may need to adjust the cooking time depending on the size and type of vegetables you are using.\n7. Once the vegetables are cooked to your liking, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.\n\nI hope these tips help you roast your vegetables to perfection!

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/misc17", "category": "difficulty-normal", "prompt": "describe the rule of this sport like I am 8 year old", "reference": "The sport being played in the image is baseball, which is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each. The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning. A full game usually has nine innings.\n- Winning the Game: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "generation": "Sure!

The other team's players try to catch the ball or get the player who hit the ball out by tagging them with the ball.

It's essential to apply sunscreen every morning, regardless of whether you plan to be outdoors.\n\n5. **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Illumination with SPF 50**: You can also apply the CC cream over your sunscreen. This product provides color correction, coverage, and additional sun protection. It can be used as a makeup base or on its own.\n\nYour morning skincare routine should typically avoid products that could increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight or that are best used when your skin is in repair mode, which is generally during the night.\n\nBased on the products you've shown:\n\n- Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant: While it is fine to use a BHA exfoliant in the morning, it's essential to follow up with sunscreen because BHAs can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Since you have a sunscreen in your lineup, this should be okay for morning use as long as you protect your skin.\n\n- Eucerin Sun Protection: This should definitely be used in your morning routine to protect your skin from UV damage throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key in the morning is to focus on protection from the sun and environmental pollutants. So, sunscreen is a must-have in your morning routine. Also, if you find that using an exfoliant every morning is too harsh for your skin, you might consider using it less frequently or applying it only in the evening.\n\nIf you experience any irritation or adverse reactions, discontinue use of the product and consult a dermatologist.", "media_filename": "difficulty-hard_skincare_f1c6093b86373581.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-hard_skincare_f1c6093b86373581.jpg", "generation": "Hello! I'm here to help you with your skincare routine. Based on the products you have, here's a suggested order for use:\n\n1. Cleanser: Start with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, oil, and makeup from your skin. You can use Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser or a similar product.\n2. Toner: Apply a toner to balance your skin's pH and remove any remaining impurities. You can use Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Toner or a similar product.\n3. Serum: Apply a serum to hydrate and nourish your skin. You can use Eucerin Daily Facial Moisturizer or a similar product.\n4.
